# Exposure Workflows

Scientific workflows to execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps can provide an efficient approach that will enable exposure scientists to leverage extant data and models for new decision contexts.  This project is using available information and modeling methods to understand: the important sources, pathways, and determinants of human exposure; variation of human exposure by location, demographics, and consumer practices; and vulnerability of populations to high-level exposure.  Relatively data-rich chemicals are being considered as test cases to drive workflow development.
